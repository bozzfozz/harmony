# Harmony Documentation Hub

Harmony documentation is now organised around audience-specific landing pages.
Visit the hub that matches your role, then dive into the linked deep dives.

## Audience Hubs
- [User & Operator Hub](user/README.md) – deployment guides, operational
runbooks, UI walkthroughs and troubleshooting material.
- [AI & Engineering Hub](ai/README.md) – architecture references, coding
standards, task templates and contributor guardrails.

## Keeping the index current
When you introduce new documentation, add it to the appropriate hub so operators
and internal contributors always land on the freshest guidance.
