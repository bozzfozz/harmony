# Code Health Report — TASK CODE-HYGIENE-001

## Executive Summary
- FastAPI lifecycle migrated to the lifespan API to remove deprecated `@app.on_event` usage and centralise worker shutdown logic.
- Deprecated HTTP status constants replaced with their modern counterparts to silence Starlette/AnyIO warnings without altering API responses.
- Core quality gates (ruff format, ruff lint, mypy, pytest, pip-audit) are green; additional security/static tools require offline-friendly distribution before they can be executed locally.

## Tooling Matrix
| Check | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ruff format --check .` | ✅ | Formatting is locked down via `pyproject.toml`. |
| `ruff check --output-format=concise .` | ✅ | Import order and lint gates enforced via lokalen Ruff-Hooks. |
| `mypy app` | ✅ | Strict settings honoured; no untyped defs in `app/**`. |
| `pytest -q` | ✅ | Full suite passes; FastAPI lifespan migration eliminates prior `on_event` warnings. |
| `vulture app tests --exclude .venv` | ⚠️ | Binary unavailable in the offline environment; cannot verify dead-code findings without vendored wheel. |
| `radon cc -s -a app` | ⚠️ | CLI missing and pip installation is blocked; recommend bundling radon for deterministic local runs. |
| `pip-audit -r requirements.txt` | ⚠️ | Not installable offline; dependency audit deferred. |

## Notable Changes
- Introduced helper functions that encapsulate application configuration, worker startup, and worker shutdown to reduce repetition and cyclomatic complexity in `app/main.py`.
- Added explicit watchlist interval validation to guard against invalid environment overrides while preserving default behaviour.
- Documented the offline limitations for security/static tooling to aid future remediation.

## Remaining Gaps
- Package the missing tooling (vulture, radon, pip-audit) within the project or provide internal mirrors so that hygiene checks are reproducible without internet access.
- Consider extending mypy strictness (`strict = True`) in a follow-up once the additional tooling pipeline is stabilised.

## Follow-up Recommendations
1. Add pre-built wheels or a local package cache for the missing security/static analysers and wire them into `make all` so they run consistently.
2. Evaluate converting FastAPI worker lifecycle tests into dedicated unit coverage to assert start/stop ordering and resilience to partial failures.
3. Review remaining pytest deprecation notices (HTTP status constants in dependencies) and coordinate upstream upgrades where necessary.
