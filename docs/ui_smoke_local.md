# UI Smoke Local Run Report

## Environment Preparation
- Attempted to install project dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt` to satisfy the `uvicorn` and `httpx` requirements. The installation failed because the environment cannot reach the package index through the configured proxy (`403 Forbidden`).
- Followed up with a direct installation attempt (`pip install uvicorn httpx`), which failed with the same proxy restriction.

## Smoke Test Execution
- Ran `bash scripts/dev/ui_smoke_local.sh`. The script exited early with the message `uvicorn is required. Install backend dependencies via 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.` No `.tmp/ui-smoke.log` file or SQLite store was created because the dependency precondition was not met.

## Observations
- Missing runtime dependencies (`uvicorn`, `httpx`) prevented the smoke test from running. The environment cannot currently install them due to the proxy blocking access to PyPI.
- Without the dependencies the script aborts before producing logs, so there are no error entries or placeholder hits to investigate or reproduce.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Obtain network access (or a local package mirror) that allows installing the required dependencies.
2. Re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Repeat `bash scripts/dev/ui_smoke_local.sh` to generate `.tmp/ui-smoke.log`, then inspect it for errors.
